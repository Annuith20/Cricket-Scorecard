**Cricket Simulation Game**
This Python program simulates a cricket match between two teams (Team A and Team B). It follows a simple text-based interface and allows users to input outcomes for each ball bowled during the match. The program keeps track of the score, wickets taken, overs bowled, and other statistics.

**Features**
Toss: The program randomly determines which team wins the toss.
Innings 1: The first team (Team A) bats, and the user inputs the outcomes for each ball bowled. The program keeps track of runs scored, wickets taken, and overs bowled.
Innings 2: The second team (Team B) chases the target set by Team A. The user again inputs outcomes for each ball bowled.
Match Result: The program determines whether Team B was able to chase the target or not and provides the final result.
How to Use
Run the Python script and follow the prompts.

Input the number of players for each team and the number of overs for the match.

The program will simulate the toss and determine which team bats first.

For each over, the user will be prompted to enter the bowler's ID, and then the user can input the outcome of each ball using the provided menu.

The program will keep track of the score, wickets, and overs for both teams.

After both innings, the program will display the match result, and you can view the detailed statistics for each player in separate text files (inning1.txt and inning2.txt).

**Example Usage****
Enter the number of players: 11

Enter the number of overs: 10

The program will simulate the toss and provide the result.

During each over, you will be prompted to enter the bowler's ID and then input the outcome for each ball using the menu.

After the first innings, you will see statistics for both teams. You can press Enter to start the second innings.

After the second innings, the program will display the final result.
